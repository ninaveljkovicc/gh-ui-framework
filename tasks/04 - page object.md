# PageObjectModel pattern using html elements dependency - Already implemented

Html elements dependency enables us to map pages of application under test as interfaces. It also provides a lot of convenient ways of manipulating with Selenium WebElements as you will see when you start writing your first test steps. This part you already got implemented because online documentation is very poor. Your task here is to try to understand this code and later on learn how to use utilities provided by this dependency.

Take a look at following files:

* htmlelements.ExtendedMyWebElement
* htmlelements.ExtendedWebPage
* htmlelements.MyWebElement
* htmlelements.MyPageFactory
* htmlelements.MyPageFactoryProvider

In the classes you will find couple of TODO comments, implement them.
